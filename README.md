# Readme: DOS 1.0 Runs on Windows 10 8 7 Vista XP portable no reboot ready to go All Needed is this one page
Simply put, this is a simple plain text web page. HTML text (code?!) to deliver binary executable OS platform, a small operation system in one single page, plain text. It is self-contentedly self-consistent. Freestanding, independent, complete, portable, green, and environment friendly. The design and development, compiling and implementation, orginate from here. 

Literally, the HTML page contains MS DOS Version 1.0 (Microsoft Built for IBM) whole system and modern visualisation environment enablement, which can run portable way: Runs on Windows 10 8 7 Vista XP in green/portable fashion. Just click to run, no installation, no reboot, no need any other more tool, software or system. All in this one single one plain text page.

Quite often, you Come across a few codes here and there; However, when you are gearing up for a real task, which becames complicated: Windows hanging for whatever you are doing; you can search anything, introduction, tutorial, or coding, but there is rarely a complete one fitting what you want. I was absorbing from traditional book reading when I was working with graphic processing under earlier OS systems. For this piece of work, I was also trying to search and adopt, however, no one fits, have to write in concise code from beginning. It is portable, you can carry this html text page in email, phone, Facebook, twitter etc and once your mood comes into play: just do simple 1-2-3 steps, and you have a running DOS 1.0 before you. No any digital rubbish left behind.

This code page has been createdwith windows simple Notepad, yes, code written in byte, not generated. HTML run/tested under Google Chrome. It is a fun project, not responsible for cross browsers' compatibility.  

Instructions (Under Chrome/Windows 10) :

(1) Google Chrome Open the ".htm" in zip (GitHub is not http host, all downloaded as Zip). Click "ready2process" for readiness and then click "ready2save2file" buttons to save files.
(2) Rename them to DOS1SYS.ZIP.001 AND DOS1SYS.ZIP.002 and use 7zip or WinRar to unpack them (7 files 1 folder).
(3) Click the RunMe.cmd to experience the most simple unique 1980s software system: Official DOS 1.0 for IBM (Not MS DOS Yet).

Some notes: There are only 7 built-in commands in DOS 1.0: 1) copy, 2) dir, 3) erase,  4) rem, 5) rename, 6) pause, 7) type. Per Apple sarcastically mocking, the infamous game: Donkey (.bas) is included, together with Ball, Bug, Music and many more. Basic/Basica are not working, I threw in GWbasic.exe in stead.
