# Readme: DOS 1.0 Runs on Windows 10 8 7 Vista XP portable no reboot ready to go All Needed is this one page
Come across quite few codes, however, when you try get a real thing done, task becames complicated: Windows hanging for whatever you are doing; you can search anything coding, but there is rarely a complete one fitting what you want. I was absorbing from reading when I was working with graphic processing under antique OS system.
For this piece of work, I was also trying to search and adop, however, no one fits, have to do it from my own.

Simply put, this is a simple code to deliver binary executable, a small operation system in one single page, plain text. Portable, green, environment friendly. The HTML text is self-contentedly self-consistent. Freestanding, independent and complete. All in one single text HTML page, as here. The page code is my origin with binary original codes from public environment, free.

Literally, the HTML page contains MS DOS Version 1.0 (Microsoft Built for IBM) whole system and enabling visualisation environment, which can run portable way: Runs on Windows 10 8 7 Vista XP in green/portable fashion. Just click to run, no installation, no reboot, no need any other more tool, software or system. All in this single one page, in plain text.

It is portable, so to speak, you can carry this html text page in email, phone, Facebook, twitter etc and once mood comes in you just follow the simple 1-2-3 steps, and you have a running DOS 1.0 in any of your desktop.

This code page has been created under Google Chrome, with windows simple Notepad, yes, code written in byte, not generated.

Instructions (self-explicitly displayed once you click to open with browser):

(1) Click "ready2process" for redainess and then click "ready2save2file" buttons to save files.
(2) Rename them to DOS1SYS.ZIP.001 AND DOS1SYS.ZIP.002 and use 7zip or WinRar to unpack them: 7 files 1 folder.
(3) Click the RunMe.cmd to enjoy the simple most unique antique software system: Official DOS 1.0 for IBM (Not MS DOS Yet).

Some notes: I gave 1 MB RAM for it, that is the minimum number I can squize down. It runs fine. I had put a Autoexec.bat to bypass the mandatory entering date/time original format. You can remove or rename it once in DOS 1.0 interface. Be advised, no "del" yet. U use one of the 7 built-in commands: "erase". The 7 DOS 1.0 built-in commands are: 1) copy, 2) dir, 3) erase,  4) rem, 5) rename, 6) pause, 7) type. Last but not the least, per Apple sarcastically mocking, the infamous game: Donkey (.bas) is included together with Ball, Bug, Music and many more. Basic/Basica are not working, I threw in GWbasic.exe in stead.
